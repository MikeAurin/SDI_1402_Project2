// Requirements:
// Remember to comment code...and remove this.
// Git commits!
// One while loop and one for loop
// At least two boolean logic expressions
// One function that doesn't return a value (a procedure)
// One function that takes two arguments and does a while loop with some kind of Boolean comparison between them. 
//   One argument should be the value returned from the confirm and the other can be any data type you choose.
// One function that does something interesting with strings after accepting two strings as arguments. 
//   This can be simple concatenation, but you are encouraged to look into other, more interesting string applications.
// One function that takes a single number and uses it in a for loop somehow, doing some math at the same time. 
//   This can be something simple like counting or summing, but again you are encouraged to look into more interesting applications.
   
/*Since three of these functions return values, you should do something interesting with the values when you get them back. 
  You are encouraged, but not required, to use the return values from earlier functions as the inputs for later functions. 
  You'll need this for Project 3, so it's something you should get comfortable with now.

// All functions take arguments
